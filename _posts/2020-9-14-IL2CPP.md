title: Hacking a IL2Cpp Game
---

# About Il2Cpp
Il2Cpp is a converter for c# that translates from IL (Intermediate Language) to normal native assembly. I think it's even made for unity. But yeah you will find it often in mobile apps and some games.

So we've got two unity il2cpp games currently being very popular: Fall Guys and... Among Us.

{: refdef}

I started playing Among Us with a few guys and thought "mhh what shenanigans could one do?".  
And I hope you're not doing the big evil piracy just because the devs are to lazy to implement proper security right? Like that would be very evil and probably wouldn't even give you all the DLCs.

# My first approach
## Dumping the game
While we can basically reverse the game like usual with Ghidra or IDA, we can get a huge headstart here.  
C# usually can be almost completely decompiled and recompiled again including variable names and method bodies.  
Here we don't have that luxury, but il2cpp saves the function names and classes (including fields) in a metadata file (called global-metadata). That means we have to reverse the method bodies on our own though.

Okay first we need the game and a program called [Il2CppDumper](https://github.com/Perfare/Il2CppDumper).  
We can run it and get a few prompts or use this:
```
Il2CppDumper.exe <executable-file> <global-metadata> <output-directory>
```

The executable is here not the `Among Us.exe`, but the `GameAssembly.dll`. The global metadata can be found (relative from the base directory) in `Among Us_Data\il2cpp_data\Metadata\`.  
So the its this:
```
Il2CppDumper.exe "GameAssembly.dll" "Among Us_Data\il2cpp_data\Metadata\global-metadata.dat" <output-directory>
```

We get a few output files including some DummyDlls, which we could use in VS or dnSpy, a `script.json` , a header and some scripts like `ida.py` and `ghidra.py` (they are actually in the base directory and don't get generated).

We can now analyze the dll in Ghidra (which takes long af) and then run the ghidra.py (and select the `script.json`).

After some long time, we can see that the script did a suboptimal job at importing the functions, but at least we know where which function is and how the classes are built.

## Actually using the gathered info
We could start a new c++ project, import the header and do our typical stuff like changing values etc. I mean we have the offsets, so that would be easy. I found something else after that, but more on that later.

### Calling Methods
We can read out of dnSpy something like this:
```csharp
[Token(Token = "0x600020E")]
[Address(RVA = "0x20C0E0", Offset = "0x20AAE0", VA = "0x1020C0E0")]
public void CompleteTask(PlayerControl pc, uint taskId);
```
The Method `CompleteTask` is then located at `GameAssembly.dll` + RVA (`0x20C0E0`).
We can also find the signature in the `script.json`:
```json
{
"Address": 2146528,
"Name": "GameData$$CompleteTask",
"Signature": "void GameData__CompleteTask (GameData_o* __this, PlayerControl_o* pc, uint32_t taskId, const MethodInfo* method);"
},
```
Notice the third parameter `const MethodInfo* method`. If we look at a call in Ghidra, in most cases we will just put there 0x0. Don't ask me why, it's some il2cpp stuff.

### Accessing Static fields
I found this playerlist as a field of `GameData`:
```csharp
// Token: 0x0400034F RID: 847
[Token(Token = "0x40001D9")]
[FieldOffset(Offset = "0x24")]
public System.Collections.Generic.List<GameData.PlayerInfo> AllPlayers;
```
Lucky for us `GameData` has a static `Instance` field:
```csharp
[Token(Token = "0x40001D8")]
[FieldOffset(Offset = "0x0")]
public static GameData Instance;
```

Okay I tried to find the solution, but I only found this (for me at the time) [useless thread](https://github.com/Perfare/Il2CppDumper/issues/199) on Github.
> Look at script.py to find something like "Class${namespace}{classname}"

I have no idea what I'm supposed to to with that info.

You could probably just use this struct (from the header) and look at the script.json address.
```csharp
struct GameData_o {
	GameData_c *klass;
	void *monitor;
	GameData_Fields fields;
};
```
Then access it via `GameData->klass->static_fields.Instance`.

Btw spoiler: You probable won't be able to access `GameData`, because it was always null for me.

# The second (for me) better way
While I was looking for a way to use the static fields, I found [this program](https://github.com/djkaty/Il2CppInspector) called Il2CppInspector which promised a better Ghidra experience, that was on-par with the IDA one (meaning with full parameters and all).  

## Dumping the game
Okay it has a nice gui and all that, but it also gives you the ability to generate a dll injection project. That sounds like exactly what I need!

Okay let's go: Select metadata file, select `GameAssembly.dll`, blabla.  
We then can select the Python Script for dissassemblers (Ghidra for me) or something else (like the DLL Injection project).

Let's go with the Ghidra route for now:  
If you don't wanna use the GUI you can use this command:
```
Il2CppInspector-cli.exe -t Ghidra -i "GameAssembly.dll" -m "Among Us_Data\il2cpp_data\Metadata\global-metadata.dat" -p <Output Dir>
```

In the output directory we have the `Ghidra.py` and the `metadata.json` and a `cpp` folder (which is the DLL injection project).
To import it into Ghidra:

1. Open up Ghidra
2. Add GameAssembly.dll
3. No auto analysis (it gets automatically analysed after the script import and doesn't create conflicts)
4. File > Parse C Source
5. New Config, add `cpp/appdata/il2cpp-types.h`
6. Parse options: `-D_GHIDRA_`
7. Click Parse
8. Add the Output folder as Script Folder
9. Run the Ghidra.py
10. Wait for like 1 hour

Okay now we have a proper reversing environment.

## Using the stuff
The generated project already has some folder structure:
* appdata (the actual data for the game like function offsets and structs)
* framework (dll entry point and il2cpp init helpers)
* user (where we will put our code)

### Calling Methods
That's pretty easy actually. You can just call something like `GaugeRandomizer_Update(gauze, 0x0)`. The last parameter is the MethodInfo* again.  
Note that some functions can't be called from other threads (like Present).

### Static types
Most classes with static fields are nicely mapped to `<class>__TypeInfo` from `il2cpp-types-ptr.h`.  
We can use the usage in Ghidra:
![Static Type in Ghidra]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/il2cpp/static_type_ghidra.png "Static Type in Ghidra")
```cpp
auto instance = GameData__TypeInfo->static_fields->Instance; 
```

### Example
Here is some code I wrote in first to test around
```cpp
void Run()
{
    while (true)
    {
        Sleep(100);
        if (IsKeyDown(VK_F5))
        {
            auto playerControlType = app::PlayerControl__TypeInfo;
            if (playerControlType != nullptr)
            {
                auto gameOptions = playerControlType->static_fields->GameOptions;
                if (gameOptions != nullptr)
                {
                    gameOptions->fields.PlayerSpeedMod = 2.f;
                }
            }
        }
}
```
Of course this is not good code, but I wanted to test around till I got the hang of it.

If you want to use the code in other files, include `il2cpp-appdata.h`. You may need to include it before any other headers. Also the precompiled header didn't fucking work for me.

# Some fun ideas
~~This game is written with pure security in mind~~
* Just see all the bad guys, I mean what's this game all about right?
* Kill People from whereever you are
* Kill yourself, this works surprisingly great
![Et tu?]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/il2cpp/et_tu.png "Et  tu?")
* Gotta go fast
* Complete tasks from whereever you are
* Kill Timer? Nah
* Jump into those vents, just to be sus. Oh you're innocent? Doesn't matter

I haven't found a way to say no to murder yet. If you hook the local function, you won't die, but the other players believe you did. Also you can't really force being a imposter.

# What to do from here?
Hook DirectX, draw a nice menu (guess what I didn't do), play around to see what shit you can do. And don't use it online. This game has no anti cheat. Just don't ruin the fun. Yes, I am saying this under a basically step to step guide how to do this. Fight me.
